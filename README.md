SECTION A: 
APPLIED MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS
•         Answer   ALL   questions   in   this   section.
•         There are 25 applied multiple choice questions. Each question   is worth   2   marks.
•         Choose the one answer that you consider best answers each question.
•         To indicate your answer, use a dark pencil to shade in neatly the   matching bubble   on   the   Teleform. sheet.
1.          Consider the topics taught in the   first   three   “modules”   of   the roadmap   for   this   course:      Business,   Systems, and Technologies. The relationship between these modules is that:
a.       Systems are used to support   Business   activities,   and   Systems   employ   various   Technologies
b.       There is no relationship between Business,   Systems, and Technology
c.       Business activities cannot exist without   Systems, and   Technology   must   be   used   in   Systems
d.       Technology, Systems, and Business are the three pillars of   Transformation
e.       Technologies support Business activities, and   Business   activities   support   Systems
2.          In class, we discussed that   disruptive   technologies   “shake up”   existing   markets   and   often   result in new markets. Businesses in the “shaken up” markets are forced to   respond   to remain competitive and sustainable. Businesses whose enterprise architectures   are   founded on the principle(s) of   are best prepared to respond.

d.       To produce a comprehensive problem tree
e.       To create the   solution   (or part   of   the   solution)The following five questions refer to Crowdmark. Crowdmark is a marking management system used in INFOSYS 110 to scan, mark, moderate, and communicate your test and exam scripts. The most important information that Crowdmark manages are the marks, which is handled by its Database Management System (DBMS). 
12.      Crowdmark is used in many courses across the   University. It has successfully   managed test and exam marks for a range of   courses   from   small   (30   students) to huge   (over   2000   students). Course   staff   hence   trust   the   system   to   manage   marks   securely:   only   staff   with the correct permissions can see students’ scripts   and   marks;   students   can   only   see   their own scripts and marks. This is an example   of   Crowdmark’s   DBMS providing:
a.         Tables and   fields
b.       An   organised   collection   of   logically   related   data
c.       Scalability   and   information   security
d.       Hardware and networks
e.         Social and cloud   computing
13.      When a question is marked, Crowdmark automatically adds up the   marks   for   each
question on every student’s script. and perfectly calculates   the   total   mark.   Crowdmark   can also alert markers to scripts which have missing pages or unmarked questions.
Crowdmark offers these functionalities to support high-quality information by ensuring   marks   are:
a.       Accurate   and timely
b.       Complete and   timely
c.         Consistent and timely
d.       Accurate and consistent
e.         Complete and consistent
14.      Students can view their marked scripts in Crowdmark using a web browser   on   a   PC.
Considering Crowdmark’s system technologies: the web browser is   ; the PC is/are   ; and scripts are received from   Crowdmark’s DBMS using   .
a.       Hardware; networks;   software
b.       Software; networks; hardware
c.       All of   the options are valid as   software, hardware,   and network   components   are   interchangeable
d.       Software; hardware; networks
e.       Hardware;   software;   networks
15.      Students log into Crowdmark using a password, and once   authenticated, they   can   only   view their own scripts. In terms of   information security, the   authentication process   is   a   form   of   control   to   mitigate   the   risk   of   violating   information   .
a.       Access;   confidentiality
b.       Physical; integrity
c.       Access;   availability
d.       Communication; confidentiality
e.       Communication;   availability

SECTION B: 
SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS 
Refer to the case attached to the end of   this booklet to answer ALL the   questions   in   this section.
The roadmap is provided as a reference and you should use   it   as   a   guide when   answering the   questions:

26.      Using evidence from the case,   identify:
a) Two of   W2's suppliers, two of   W2’s customers, and one of   W2’s partners.   (5 marks)
b)      Which value discipline W2 primarily focusses on, and a corresponding   Value   Chain   Activity W2 should invest in to excel in the   discipline.   Justify your   answers.   (3 marks)
c)      How W2 adds value for their customers.   (2 marks)(10 marks)
27.      Consider the model of   the W2’s “Hydrometer smart meter installation process” provided below to answer this question.

a)      For any two steps of   the process model, suggest   a   specific information   system that could be used to support the step. Draw your answers on the model   provided   in   your   answer booklet. (2 marks)
b)      For any two steps of   the process model, suggest a   department   within   W2   that   would perform. the step. Draw your answers on the model provided in your answer booklet. (2 marks)
Note: the steps you choose for questions a) and b) may be the same steps; you may choose any two steps for either question. 
c)       Our definition of   a business process stated it “achieves a   specific   outcome”   .   What   is   achieved in this process?   (2 marks)
d)      Suggest one way Business Analytics could be used to improve this process for either   W2 or its customers.   (4   marks)(10 marks) 
28.      Information   Systems consist of   interwoven components that deliver value. Using
evidence   from   the   case, identify   examples   of   the   components   of   Hydrometer.
Hydrometer is W2's water usage monitoring and management system. For each example,   briefly explain why it is necessary for the overall Information   System to   function   and deliver value.(10 marks) 29.      Before W2 can run their “WaterWise world-wide” (W4) campaign, some preparation   is   required. The necessary activities will be performed in a project named “Prep for   W4”   .
Some details about Prep   for   W4:
•         It   is   scheduled   to   start   at   the   beginning   of   January   2019.
•         All   activities   must   be   completed   before   the   end   of   July   2019, around   two weeks before International Water Week.
•         A crucial activity is to finalise agreements with the   charities involved.
•         Another   crucial   activity   is   to   correctly   calculate   the   benchmark   water   consumption quantity.
•         The lead project manager is Nat Dean.
•         Including   Nat, there   are   six   members   of   W2 staff   working   on   this   project. Nat is assigned full time (approximately 40 hours per week), all other   staff   are
allocated half-time (approximately 20 hours per week per person).
a)      What is the time constraint of   the Prep for W4 project?   (2 marks)
b)      What is the cost constraint of   the Prep for W4 project?   (2 marks)
c)      Assume the project experiences delays, and with the deadline imminent, both the
crucial activities have yet to be completed.   Suggest one way Nat can “balance” the constraints   of   this   project. Also   explain   the   impact   of   your   suggestion   on   the   “quality”   of   the   Prep   for   W4 project. (4 marks)(8 marks) 
30.      In this course we have frequently discussed how information systems   (IS),   information   technologies (IT), and operations management (OM) techniques, when used well, generate business value.
For   EACH   of   the   categories   of   value   below:
•         Describe   how   W2's   use   of   IS   or   IT   or   OM   generate   value   for   itself.
•         For your answer above (the value generated for W2), provide a   specific   key   performance indicator (KPI) to measure it.
•         For your answer above (the KPI), state whether W2 would want   its   figure to
increase, decrease, stay the same, or to be ignored   completely. Briefly   justify your choice.
a)      Reduce costs
b)      Increase customer satisfaction
c)       Create competitive advantages(12 marks)
